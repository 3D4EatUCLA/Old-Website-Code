                                    printer, the Printrbot Simple 1401, in 2014.  Ever since that, he has caught the printing 
                                    bug, deconstructing, modifying, and learning from various printers ranging from the AIO 
                                    Zeus' to Ultimakers along with his current endeavor of using 3D printed components to build
                                    a D-Bot, CoreXY 3D printer.  In addition to bouts of sporadic veganism, James is passionate
